## Why this blog exists

Hello there! My name is Guillermo. I'm a recent gradute from a Financial Engineering Master's program. I created this site with the objective of keeping my knowledge fresh, and as a tool to motivate myself to continuously learn more about the field. I also hope it can be of use for those who find themeselves interested in topics of financial mathematics and computational finance.
